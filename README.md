# Script to synchronize two Git repositories

## Download

```shell
mkdir <synchronization-folder> && cd <synchronization-folder>
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adidik/git-repos-sync/master/git-repos-sync
chmod +x git-repos-sync
```

or

```shell
mkdir <synchronization-folder> && cd <synchronization-folder>
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adidik/git-repos-sync/master/git-repos-sync
chmod +x git-repos-sync
```

## Usage

Just run the script with 3 parameters:

- URL of first repository (left).
- URL of second repository (right).
- Branch to sync up.

```shell
./git-repos-sync <URL> <URL> <branch>
```

Both repositories must be accessible on server you execute the script.

On first run script will init Git repository in script's folder and add
left and right repositories as remotes. Then first attempt to sync
specified branch will be made.

In case if synchronization is not possible because of merge conflict,
resolve it manually and just rerun script. It will automatically try to
continue synchronization.

In case if sync repo has uncommitted modifications, script will exit with
warning.

## How does it work

Script makes next actions to sync up two repos:

1. Fetch specified branch from left repo and right repo.
2. Create sync branch based on right repo branch.
3. Merge left repo branch, if merge conflict, stop for manual resolution.
4. Push sync branch to right repo.
5. Push sync branch to left repo.
6. Remove sync branch.

In case of merge conflict, then:

1. Wait while conflict will be solved manually and committed.
2. Fetch specified branch from left repo and right repo.
3. Merge sync branch with right repo branch, if merge conflict, stop for
   manual resolution.
4. Merge left repo branch, if merge conflict, stop for manual resolution.
5. Push sync branch to right repo.
6. Push sync branch to left repo.
7. Remove sync branch.

See below different cases.

### Already synced up

Initial:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C <-  left/branch, right/branch

Right repo: A-B-C <-branch
```

Fetch:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C <-  sync-branch, left/branch, right/branch

Right repo: A-B-C <-branch
```

Merge:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C <-  sync-branch, left/branch, right/branch

Right repo: A-B-C <-branch
```

Push and remove sync branch:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C <-  left/branch, right/branch

Right repo: A-B-C <-branch
```

### Left ahead

Initial:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C-D <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C <-  left/branch, right/branch

Right repo: A-B-C <-branch
```

Fetch:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C-D <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C-D <-  left/branch
				^-- sync-branch, right/branch		

Right repo: A-B-C <-branch
```

Merge:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C-D <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C-D <-  sync-branch, left/branch
				^-- right/branch

Right repo: A-B-C <-branch
```

Push and remove sync branch:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C-D <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C-D <-  left/branch, right/branch

Right repo: A-B-C-D <-branch
```

### Right ahead

Initial:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C <-  left/branch, right/branch

Right repo: A-B-C-D <-branch
```

Fetch: plaintext

```
Left repo:  A-B-C <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C-D <-  sync-branch, right/branch
				^-- left/branch		

Right repo: A-B-C-D <-branch
```

Merge:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C-D <- sync-branch, right/branch
				^-- left/branch

Right repo: A-B-C-D <-branch
```

Push and remove sync branch:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C-D <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C-D <- left/branch, right/branch

Right repo: A-B-C-D <-branch
```

### Diverged

Initial:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C-D <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C <- left/branch, right/branch

Right repo: A-B-C-E <-branch
```

Fetch:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C-D <- branch

Sync repo:  A-B-C-E <- sync-branch, right/branch
				'-D <- left/branch		

Right repo: A-B-C-E <-branch
```

Merge:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C-D <- branch

                   ,- right/branch
Sync repo:  A-B-C-E-F <-  sync-branch
				'-D-' <- left/branch	

Right repo: A-B-C-E <-branch
```

Push and remove sync branch:

```plaintext
Left repo:  A-B-C-E-F <- branch
				'-D-' 

                   
Sync repo:  A-B-C-E-F <- left/branch, right/branch
				'-D-' 

Right repo: A-B-C-E-F <- branch
				'-D-' 
```
